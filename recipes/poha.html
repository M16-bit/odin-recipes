    <h3>Desciption</h3>
    <p>Poha (flattened rice) is typically a Western Indian breakfast recipe but itâ€™s taste and ease of making has made it extremely popular all over India.</p>
    <p>Poha is one of the popular Indian breakfasts (especially in North and western India).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flattened rice</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To a strainer, add flattened rice (poha). Rinse it under running water until it turns soft.</li>
        <li>To check if it is done, press a flake between your thumb and index finger, it should break easily.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the poha and toss to combine. Set it aside while you make the tempering in the pan.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop. Then add the peanuts and saute for a minute or two until they start turning brown.</li>
        <li>Then add the chopped onion, green chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 minutes until the onions soften.</li>
        <li>Then add in the rinsed poha and toss to combine. Taste test some poha and if it feels dry, sprinkle little water all over (I usually do that). Cook for 1-2 minutes.  Also tastes test and add more salt as needed at this point (I added around 1/8 teaspoon). Also add the sugar (if using) and cilantro.</li>
        <li>And then cover the pan with a lid and turn heat to low. Let it be like that for 2 minutes. Then turn off the heat.
            Squeeze in some fresh lemon juice. Garnish poha with more cilantro and sev and serve with a cuppa chai.</li>
    </ol>
