        <li>1 tsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 red and 1 green pepper, deseeded and diced</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 x 400g cans plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 x 400g cans red kidney beans, undrained</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable bouillon powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>

        <li>15g coriander, chopped, plus extra to serve, if you like</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss the paneer with 1/2 tsp of the paprika. Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat, then fry the paneer, turning until golden. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate, then add the peppers, garlic and celery, remaining cumin, paprika and chilli flakes, and briefly stir over the heat. Tip in the tomatoes and beans along with their juice, the bouillon powder and oregano. Use a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes if needed, then leave to simmer, uncovered, for 20 mins until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the quinoa following pack instructions, drain and set aside for 10 mins. Stir the coriander and paneer into the beans, and sprinkle over extra coriander just before serving. Serve half the chilli with half the quinoa. The remainder will keep chilled for up to three days. Reheat in the microwave or on the hob, covered, over a medium heat with a drop of water to loosen until piping hot.</li>
    </ol>
